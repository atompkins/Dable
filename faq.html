					<p class="lead">How do I use Dable?</p>
					<p>Dable is really easy to use.  There are lots of examples all over this
					site and the readme on GitHub.  The simplest Dable is done like this:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
var dable = new Dable();
var data = [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ];
var columns = [ 'Odd', 'Even' ];
dable.SetDataAsRows(data);
dable.SetColumnNames(columns);
dable.BuildAll("DefaultDable");
</pre>
					But there are lots of other ways to use it.  If you prefer HTML over
					Javascript, you can build an HTML table and build dable in one line of
					Javascript like this:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&lt;div id="TableDable"&gt;
	&lt;table&gt;
		&lt;thead&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;
				&lt;th&gt;Odd&lt;/th&gt;
				&lt;th&gt;Even&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;/thead&gt;
		&lt;tbody&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
	var dable2 = new Dable("TableDable");
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
					And of course this is just showing a little bit of what Dable can do.
					Check out the <a href="http://deltreey.github.io/Dable/">Examples</a>
					and the <a href="https://github.com/deltreey/Dable/wiki">Wiki</a> to
					see more.
					</p>
					
					<a class="anchor" id="faq2"></a>
					<p class="lead">It's not working.</p>
					<p>First, make sure you've included Dable as a script tag in your
					&lt;head&gt;
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&lt;script src="Dable.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
					If that doesn't fix it, then you should double check that you're trying to
					build your Dable with a &lt;div&gt; element instead of the &lt;table&gt;
					<br />
					Finally, Dable doesn't use the # from JQuery on the id of the element.
					Make sure you didn't add it by accident, or just wrap the id in a basic
					Jquery selector.
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
var dable = new Dable("DivId");
</pre>
					OR, if you're using JQuery and would prefer it.
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
var dable = new Dable($("#DivId"));
</pre>
					Though, just a heads up, that's kind of redundant.</p>
					
					<a class="anchor" id="faq3"></a>
					<p class="lead">Can I just get a template HTML page?  This is confusing</p>
					<p><em>Sure!</em><br />
					The example pages are all really simple HTML examples of Dable
					in action.  If you want to use Javascript data, check out the source for
					the
					<a href="http://deltreey.github.io/Dable/Examples/Default">Default Example</a>.
					If you prefer an HTML table, check out the source for the
					<a href="http://deltreey.github.io/Dable/Examples/FromTable">From Table Example</a>.</p>
					
					<a class="anchor" id="faq4"></a>
					<p class="lead">Do I need &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; and &lt;tfoot&gt; tags?</p>
					<p><em>thead Yes, tbody Yes, tfoot No</em><br />
					Dable finds out your column names and controls sorting based on the
					cells in the first row of your thead tag, so this is a necessary element.
					In fact, dable sends you a message in the console telling you there was
					an error when you try to build a Dable on a table without a thead element.
					Dable gathers your data as rows from your tbody tag.  So you need this also.
					The tfoot element is not necessary, but Dable does not remove it.  It is
					sometimes useful to use the tfoot element to allow users to add rows to
					the table.</p>
					<p>Of course, you don't even need a &lt;table&gt; tag if you build your
					Dable as a javascript array.</p>
					
					<a class="anchor" id="faq5"></a>
					<p class="lead">Can I use Dable with ASP.NET GridViews?</p>
					<p><em>Absolutely!</em><br /> You only need to make sure that the gridview
					has a thead element. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/309101/how-do-i-get-gridview-to-render-thead">See this stackoverflow question.</a></p>
					
					<a class="anchor" id="faq10"></a>
					<p class="lead">Can I turn off sorting for certain columns?</p>
					<p><em>Of Course!</em></p>
					<p>Each column in your Dable has a corresponding columnData object.  This
					is a javascript array, which is 0 based, so Column 3 is dable.columnData[2].
					The columnData object has a CustomSortFunc property which allows you to set
					custom sort functions for uniquely sorted columns.  If you want to turn off
					sorting altogether, you need only set it to false.  It would look like this:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
dable.columnData[2].CustomSortFunc = false;
</pre></p>

					<a class="anchor" id="faq12"></a>
					<p class="lead">Can I display rows uniquely based on the data with Dable?</p>
					<p><em>You sure can!</em></p>
					<p>Each column in your Dable has a corresponding columnData object.  This
					is a javascript array, which is 0 based, so Column 3 is dable.columnData[2].
					The columnData object has a CustomRendering property which allows you to set
					custom rendering functions for any of your columns.  You could display your
					columns as links, or images, just by changing the rendering.  Additionally,
					this feature allows you to display the data one way, but still sort and filter
					the data based on the data in the dable.columns array.  The rendering is just that.
					It does not in any way alter the data itself.  Here's an example:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
dable.columnData[0].CustomRendering = function (cellValue) {
	//display the cell with a link to details
	return '&lt;a target="_blank" href="/?cell=' + cellValue + '"&gt;' + cellValue + '&lt;/a&gt;';
};
</pre></p>

					<a class="anchor" id="faq11"></a>
					<p class="lead">Dable's kind of slow with 100,000+ rows</p>
					<p>Dable is a javascript library.  Therefore, it is only as fast as your computer,
					or more specifically, your browser.  Some browsers, like IE8 do not handle lots of
					javascript well, so Dable will run slower when you start to put a ginormous amount
					of data in it.</p>
					<p><em>Luckily, there are options!</em></p>
					<p>Dable does allow you to work with remote data sets.  This is fairly complex
					though, so I recommend you think long and hard before deciding that this is the
					best option.  Additionally, printing the data in a Dable becomes flat out impossible
					when you do this (it's not all on the screen at once).  There are a lot of features that are needed for this.  When I get
					a good tutorial up that demonstrates Dable's async features, I will add a link to it
					here.  For now, you're going to have to read the source code.  Sorry.</p>
					
					<a class="anchor" id="faq6"></a>
					<p class="lead">Why do you build Dable on the &lt;div&gt; instead of the
					&lt;table&gt;?</p>
					<p>Dable doesn't just build an HTML table.  You can do that yourself.
					Dable does page sizing and search in a &lt;div&gt; which it creates before
					your table.  Then Dable adds a &lt;div&gt; after your table to handle
					paging and to display the size of the data and if you've done any
					filtering.</p>
					
					<a class="anchor" id="faq7"></a>
					<p class="lead">Why IE 8?</p>
					<p>Every organization I've worked at since 2011 (when IE 9 came out) has
					been using IE 8.  While I think it is a very outdated browser, I wanted
					to create a framework that would be able to be used anywhere I work, and
					most of the places anyone else works.  Would I prefer to encourage the use
					of more modern browsers?  Yes, of course.  Do I want to alienate users
					(read: developers) because their company won't get with the program?
					Absolutely not.</p>
					<p>I considered the possibility of supporting browsers older than IE 8,
					but IE 8 is the oldest browser to support the javascript feature
					querySelector which works a lot like JQuery's selector and allows me to
					keep Dable's code for traversing the DOM from being a massive mess.</p>
					
					<a class="anchor" id="faq8"></a>
					<p class="lead">Why doesn't Dable use JQuery?</p>
					<p>Dable is a tool, nothing more, nothing less.  The simpler the tool is,
					the less time you have to spend reading the owner's manual.  JQuery was
					not necessary to make it function, so I did not require it.  You can
					certainly use Dable and JQuery together.  In fact, one of Dable's default
					supported styles is based on JQueryUI.  But I didn't want to force you to
					have to download extra files in order to get Dable to run.</p>
					<p>Additionally, Dable actually runs faster because it doesn't use JQuery.
					And there's <a href="http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/">this</a>.</p>
					
					<a class="anchor" id="faq9"></a>
					<p class="lead">Why isn't Dable MVC (or some other pattern)?</p>
					<p>MVC is a pattern.  A pattern is a way of organizing code so it is
					easier for future developers to edit your code.  Dable is a tool, which
					means it benefits from simplicity, rather than complexity.  I have plans
					to make Dable's code easier to work with in the future, but it will always
					compile down to a single javascript file which takes in data and spits out
					html.  That means that it will always do some of the function of the
					MVC controller, and some of the function of the MVC view.</p>
					<p>I am a fan of single file plugins.  Smaller is better with tools.  You
					can do a whole lot more with a hammer than you can with a
					<a href="http://www.milwaukeetool.com/instruments/lighting-testers/2210-20">
					Milwaukee Tools Fluorescent Light Tester</a>.
					Because Dable is so simple, you can plug it in anywhere and just use it.
					I don't want to clutter that simplicity and force my users to host a whole
					lot of files on their server and add more clutter to the &lt;head&gt;
					element.</p>
